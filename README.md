# React Boilerplate 1.0.0
 A simple react boilerplate!
 
### What is this ?

This is an extremely simple react boilerplate, built with the following modules:

  - NodeJS
  - ExpressJS
  - Webpack
  - Babel
  - React
  - Foundation (for styling)
  - Karma/mocha for testing
  - SCSS as css preproc (node-sass and sass-lodaer included. webpack configured.)
  - ...

Look up package.JSON for further details on the dependencies.



### How to install ?
First off, if you don't have webpack installed globally, do so by running ``` $ sudo npm install -g webpack ```.

**For Linux/Mac users**:
Clone the repository into one of your folders, then Cd into it:
``` 
$ git clone git@github.com:ghuenlee/ReactBoilerplate2.git
$ cd ReactBoilerplate2
```
Once cloned and opened, type these commands in the terminal to install dependencies and start the app:
``` 
$ sudo npm install
$ webpack
$ node server
```
Done! just open your brower and head to localhost:3000. Voila!

**Windows users**, follow the same steps, though use Â ``` $ npm install ``` instead of ``` $ sudo npm install ```.
